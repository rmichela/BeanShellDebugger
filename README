OVERVIEW:
BeanShellDebugger gives you complete access to the internal state of
a live bukkit server using BeanShell (http://www.beanshell.org/). 
BSHD is a great tool for debugging plugins and bukkit core.

BeanShell is extremely powerful. Read its docs to learn its subtle
ways.

INSTALLATION:
1. Download BeanShell 2.0b4 from http://www.beanshell.org/download.html
2. Put bsh-2.0b4.jar into your root bukkit directory
3. Put BeanShellDebugger.jar into your bukkit plugin directory

USAGE:
Connect to BeanShell one of four ways
1. Web - http://localhost:1337
2. Telnet - telnet localhost 1338
3. Server console - bshd java command;
4. MC Client - /bshd java command;

A few shortcut symbols have been defined within the BeanShell runtime:
pluginLoader, pluginManager, classLoader, and server. Additionally,
a symbol is defined for each loaded plugin instance and named the
class name of the plugin.


Most useful command: print(someJavaExpression());

EXTENSION:
Any .bsh scripts added to the BeanShellDebugger plugin data folder
(in the plugins directory) will be loaded into the BeanShell
environment and can be used in your queries. This is a great place
to write snippets that automate your common commands.
